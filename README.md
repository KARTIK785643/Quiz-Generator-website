The Quiz Generator Website is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows admins to create and manage quizzes by adding multiple-choice questions, while users can attempt quizzes and view their scores.

Frontend (React.js): Interactive user interface for taking quizzes and viewing results.

Backend (Node.js + Express.js): RESTful API for handling quiz creation, retrieval, and submission.

Database (MongoDB): Stores quiz questions, user attempts, and scores.
